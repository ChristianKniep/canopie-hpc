## ABOUT
**Containers and New Orchestration Paradigms for Isolated Environments in HPC (CANOPIE-HPC)** is a workshop focusing on containerization, virtualization, and other methods to implement user-defined, bring-your-own, or isolated software environments. The third workshop will be hosted at the 2021 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC21). The objective of this workshop is to serve as the principal venue for leaders in the field to stimulate research and interactions in relation to cutting-edge container technologies, virtualization, and OS system software as it relates to supporting High Performance Computing (HPC).
