### CALL FOR PAPERS:

We are pleased to introduce the 1st International Workshop on Containers and New Orchestration Paradigms for Isolated Environments in HPC (CANOPIE HPC), to be hosted at SC19: The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis. The objective of this workshop is to serve as the principal venue for leaders in the field to stimulate research and interactions in relation to cutting-edge container technologies, virtualization, and OS system software as it relates to supporting High Performance Computing (HPC). The first iteration of this workshop will give special attention to work which can provide real-world experiences to containerization in HPC, as well as promote the use of containers and engage in a collaborative manner with the larger HPC community.

Container computing has revolutionized the way groups are developing, sharing, and running software and services.  This has initially been led by growth with Docker, which has provided an ecosystem of tools to enable container based computing.  This paradigm shift has since made in-roads in the HPC community enabled by container runtimes like Singularity, Shifter, and Charliecloud, which allow end-users to run containers in environments where standard Docker tools would not be feasible.  Orchestration systems such as Kubernetes allow for quick, scalable service deployments in conjunction with HPC. While this adoption is growing, the larger HPC community still has many questions around this new model. There still exist several undefined research questions related to containerization in HPC that the community must address.

### TOPICS OF INTEREST (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO):

* HPC Container Runtimes
* Utilizing Containers to improve Portability and Reproducibility
* Experience using containers for HPC high-performance computing applications including data analytics, machine learning, modeling and simulation.
* Virtualization in supercomputing environments & HPC clusters
* Container runtime designs for Exascale
* HPC in the cloud
* Accelerator and GPU virtualization
* Container security and trust models including container distribution
* In-situ HPC & Analysis coupling experiments
* Workflow ensemble coupling with containers
* Performance and scaling studies with containers and/or VMs
* Container services orchestration and microservices with HPC
* On-node resource partitioning with OS mechanisms
* Combined container and OS/VM designs
* DevOps models with containers and image registries

### SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

Regular research paper – Regular paper submissions target original, high-quality submissions in containers, operating systems research, virtualization, and their relation to HPC. Regular paper submissions are limited to 10 pages (including figures, tables, and references).

Short research paper – These submissions target work-in-progress research and position papers on potentially controversial or emerging and hot topics in the area of containers, virtualization, and OS research. These submissions could include work from industry, state of the practice, and other relevant work. Short paper submissions are limited to 4 pages (including figures, tables, and references).

Submissions of both types should be made online via Linklings: https://submissions.supercomputing.org/?page=Submit&id=SC19WorkshopCANOPIEHPCSubmission&site=sc19

Submitted papers will be peer-reviewed and accepted papers will be published through the IEEE Technical Concortium on High Performance Computing – TCHPC.  All authors should follow the IEEE TCHPC publication format.  Templates can be found at  https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html
